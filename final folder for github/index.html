    <p style= "font-size:18px;">My topic is on the happiness of countries worldwide, with a focus on the factors affecting one&apos;s life fulfillment (such as married vs single, quality of healthcare systems, biological influences) and this is derived by comparing the demographics of people within countries that are happier. We will also be looking at other interesting findings regarding happiness, such as the change in happiness levels over the years (indicating global events).</p>

    <h1 style="margin-top:100px; margin-bottom:0px; font-size:30px; color:firebrick">Why is learning about happiness important?</h1>

  <p style= "font-size:18px;">According to
      <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_governments_should_care_more_about_happiness">Diener,</a>
      a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia and the University of Utah, their research suggests that happy people are more effective in achieving valued goals, contribute positively to society by helping others lead high-quality lives, and are not uncaring or selfish.</p>
  <p style= "font-size:18px;">
      <a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2015/04/23/why-happiness-is-important/">The Columbia Climate School</a>
suggests that using data on happiness can inform policy-making and collaborative problem-solving for local and national governments, as well as track the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving well-being and reducing inequality over time.</p>

    <p>The <b>World Happiness Report</b> released its annual ranking of the happiest countries in the world and for the sixth year in a row Finland has landed in the top spot.</p>
    <p>The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, the organization behind the report, uses six key factors to help rank the more than 150 countries based on their average life evaluations between 2019-2021:</p>
    <p>(<b>Hover</b> over each key factor to view detailed information!)</p>
    <p style="font-size:18px; color:firebrick"><b>
      1. Social support
    <span class="extra">Social support is the national average of the binary responses (0=no, 1=yes) to the Gallup World Poll (GWP) question &quot;If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?&quot;</span></p>
    </b></p>
    <p style="font-size:18px; color:firebrick"><b>
    2. Income
    <span class="extra2">GDP per capita is in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjusted to constant 2017 international dollars, taken from the World Development Indicators (WDI) released by the World Bank on December 16, 2021. See Statistical Appendix 1 for more details. GDP data for 2021 are not yet available, so we extend the GDP time series from 2020 to 2021 using country-specific forecasts of real GDP growth from the OECD Economic Outlook No. 110 (Edition December 2021) or, if missing, the World Bank&apos;s Global Economic Prospects (Last Updated: 01/11/2022), after adjustment for population growth. The equation uses the natural log of GDP per capita, as this form fits the data significantly better than GDP per capita.</span></p>

      3. Health

        <p>
          There weren't much decrease in factors when rankings worsen in 2017 to
          2019, except for drop in GDP per capita and generosity from 2017 to
          2018.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, happiness scores dropped to the lowest in 2019, which could
          have been circumstancial factors not accounted for like COVID-19 as
          factors did not drop from 2018 to 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          GDP per capita increased rapidly from 2020 and 2022, which is coupled
          with a slight increase in happiness score.
        </p>
        <p>
          GDP per capita also dropped slightly along with happiness scores from
          2017 to 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can therefore hypothesise that GDP per capita affects happiness,
          while factors like social support or generosity do not.
