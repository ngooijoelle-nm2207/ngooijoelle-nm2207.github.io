        <a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2015/04/23/why-happiness-is-important/">The Columbia Climate School</a>

      1. Social support
<!-- hover over words for more words to appear using <span> -->
<!-- &quot; to replace quotation marks to prevent breakings -->
    <span class="extra">Social support is the national average of the binary responses (0=no, 1=yes) to the Gallup World Poll (GWP) question &quot;If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?&quot;</span></p>

    2. Income
    <span class="extra2">GDP per capita is in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjusted to constant 2017 international dollars, taken from the World Development Indicators (WDI) released by the World Bank on December 16, 2021. See Statistical Appendix 1 for more details. GDP data for 2021 are not yet available, so we extend the GDP time series from 2020 to 2021 using country-specific forecasts of real GDP growth from the OECD Economic Outlook No. 110 (Edition December 2021) or, if missing, the World Bank&apos;s Global Economic Prospects (Last Updated: 01/11/2022), after adjustment for population growth. The equation uses the natural log of GDP per capita, as this form fits the data significantly better than GDP per capita.</span></p>

        <p>Singapore's world happiness ranking ranges from 22 to 34.</p>
        <p>
          Happiness rankings have worsened starting from 2017 to 2019, with
          lowest ranking in both 2018 and 2019.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          There weren't much decrease in factors when rankings worsen in 2017 to
          2019, except for drop in GDP per capita and generosity from 2017 to
          2018.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, happiness scores dropped to the lowest in 2019, which could
          have been circumstancial factors not accounted for like COVID-19 as
          factors did not drop from 2018 to 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          GDP per capita increased rapidly from 2020 and 2022, which is coupled
          with a slight increase in happiness score.
        </p>
        <p>
          GDP per capita also dropped slightly along with happiness scores from
          2017 to 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can therefore hypothesise that GDP per capita affects happiness,
          while factors like social support or generosity do not.
