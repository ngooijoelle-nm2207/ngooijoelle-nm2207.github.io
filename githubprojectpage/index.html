        <h2>Storyboard</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Background</b></td>
    <td>My topic is on the happiness of countries worldwide, with a focus on the factors affecting one’s life fulfillment (such as married vs single, quality of healthcare systems, biological influences) and this is derived by comparing the demographics of people within countries that are happier. We will also be looking at other interesting findings regarding happiness, such as the change in happiness levels over the years (indicating global events).
        My rationale for choosing this topic is because we all define life fulfillment and happiness differently, so I am interested in finding out what causes some people to feel happier than others. It is a philosophical question of “what makes life meaningful” that all of us are striving to know so that we can achieve our happiest state.

    <td><b>Data</b></td>
    <td>I will be using a factor-based data story.
      <p>I have pulled data from</p>
      <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/#appendices-and-data">https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/#appendices-and-data</a>
      to get the ranking of happiness worldwide from 2019–2022 using a barplot→ file: barplot for happiness 2022. I have future plans of getting the data for regional trends of happiness-suporting factors. By getting the ranking of happiness, I can compare it with other factors like GDP per capita, healthcare expenditure, education level etc. to find out the different variables that could have led to the differences in happiness.

      <p>I have also pulled data from
        <a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/happiness-data/id/1d38fdc3">https://databank.worldbank.org/happiness-data/id/1d38fdc3</a>
        to create a world map, with strength of legal rights and gdp per capita as variables (I hope to incorporate three more variables such as school enrollment for tertiary(%), healthcare expenditure), so that I can compare the patterns in variables within the same year with the happiness data I get from other data sources.
      </p>

      <p>I want to also find data on the changes in happiness worldwide/within a region over time, to account for any global issues such as the pandemic that may have impacted happiness levels.</p>
      <p>I am still looking for data in determining whether getting married actually leads to greater happiness as seen from the study 
      <a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/does-getting-married-really-make-you-happier#:~:text=Indeed%2C%20married%20people%20are%20happier,and%2015%25%20for%20people%20who">https://ifstudies.org/blog/does-getting-married-really-make-you-happier#:~:text=Indeed%2C%20married%20people%20are%20happier,and%2015%25%20for%20people%20who</a>
      , but I have not been able to find raw data on this. I also want to expand my research on biological factors on happiness. There was a study on a pair of twins → need raw data 
      </p>
      <p><b>Flow of data story:</b>
        Introduce topic → show the trend and facts and provide data analysis for every data set → go into a more philosophical approach and answer research questions (conclusion)

    <td><b>Problem Statement</b></td>
    <td>
      As the world gradually becomes more affluent, more people are reaching the self-actualization stage according to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, where they start to question what makes life fulfilling and how they can live life to the fullest. With increased awareness about mental health, it is also crucial to learn about factors that affect one’s tendency to feel happier because mental health is just as essential as physical health.
      <p><b>Research question:</b> What are the factors influencing one to feel more happy/depressed? What makes life meaningful?</p>
